#### The Observer Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object (the Subject) to notify a list of dependent objects (the Observers) about state changes, typically by calling one of their methods. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where a change in one object requires updating others, and you want to minimize coupling between these objects.
