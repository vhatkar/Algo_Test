#### The Observer Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object (the Subject) to notify a list of dependent objects (the Observers) about state changes, typically by calling one of their methods. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where a change in one object requires updating others, and you want to minimize coupling between these objects.


>   Subject Class: Manages a list of observers and notifies them of state changes.
    ConcreteSubject Class: Implements the Subject interface and maintains the state.
    Observer Class: Defines the update method that concrete observers must implement.
    ConcreteObserverA and ConcreteObserverB Classes: Implement the Observer interface and define specific reactions to state changes.

> In the unit test, MagicMock is used to create mock observers that can track method calls. The test ensures that observers are notified when the subject's state changes, verifying the correct implementation of the Observer Pattern.
